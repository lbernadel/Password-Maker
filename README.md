## Description
The purpose of this project was to create a random password generating application for company with employees who have access to sensitive company information. The application prompts the user for selection of the following criteria:

- Length of 8 to 128 characters
- At least one of these character types:
  - Lowercase letters
  - Uppercase letters
  - Numbers
  - Special characters

The application validates that the user choose a length within range and at least one character type prior to generating a random password. Once a password is created, it appears and the user is able to copy it to their clipboard to save elsewhere.
